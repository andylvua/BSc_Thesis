I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Kseniia Kretsula, the project intern, for her continuous assistance throughout this work. Her contributions were essential, particularly in organizing and executing the experimental setups, which would not have been possible without her dedication and technical involvement.

I am deeply grateful to my girlfriend, Anastasiia Shvets, for her constant support, encouragement, and patience. Her care, understanding, steadiness, and willingness to help throughout the most demanding periods of this work were invaluable.

I would like to thank my advisor, Oleg Farenyuk, for introducing me to this project and for his guidance throughout. His insights, feedback, and support were invaluable in shaping both the direction and execution of this work.

Special thanks go to my friend, Pavlo Kryven, for always being available to discuss and give advice. His openness and perspective helped me reflect on and refine many aspects of this project.

I also wish to thank the volunteers who participated in the experimental phase. Their time and help were vital to the successful collection of the dataset used in this research.

Finally, I acknowledge Oleg Kapshii and Igor Kravets from Infineon Technologies for their support, and for providing the hardware and technical validation necessary for this work.
